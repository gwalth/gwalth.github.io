<p>I'm Greg Walth, a postdoc at <a
href="https://obs.carnegiescience.edu">Carnegie Observatories</a>. I work
with Gwen Rudie, Sean Johnson and John Mulchaey on studying the
circumgalactic medium around galaxies. I'm leading a Magellan survey of
galaxies imaged with <i>Hubble</i> Space Telescope (<i>HST</i>) snapshot program (PI: Sean Johnson) of quasar host
environments.  The goal of the project is to empirically determine if
galaxies within the virial radius of a quasar are dynamically disturbing
the cool circumgalactic gas such that it is feeding the quasar's black
hole.

<p>I also study the formation and evolution of dusty, star-forming galaxies
(DSFGs). In particular, I utilize gravitational lensing (from foreground
clusters and galaxies) to investigate the interstellar medium at high
spatial resolution (10-100 pcs) within DSFGs. I've been conducting optical
and near-IR spectroscopic follow-up of Herschel selected DSFGs in order to
characterize their nebular emission, which can be used determine the
instantaneous star formation, chemical enrichment, stellar population, dust
attenuation and whether they contain an AGN. The Herschel sample I'm
working with comes from the <a
href="http://herschel.as.arizona.edu/hls/hls.html">Herschel Lensing Survey
(HLS)</a> which surveyed
nearly 600 massive galaxy clusters.</p>

</p> Additionally, I'm interested in data reduction pipelines, and helped develop the IRIS pipeline for the <a href="https://www.tmt.org">Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)</a>. <a href="https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/IRIS.html">IRIS</a> is a
near-IR IFU which will work at the diffraction limit of TMT.</p>
