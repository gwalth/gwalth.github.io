The first <i>HST</i> surveys of galaxies at redshifts <i>z > 1</i> found
that this population of galaxies have clumpy morphologies. These clumps are
thought to be giant star-forming regions, much larger and luminous than the
ones found in nearby galaxies. However, it is unclear whether these clumps
are real or artifacts of the telescope's resolution. Surveys of
gravitationally lensed sources have only exacerbated the problem as they
have found many large clumps and small clumps with an apparent redshift
evolution of size and luminosity. However, the selection of this population
is highly biased as it primarily selects a galaxy's UV/optical emission.
Here we find a gravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxy at redshift
<i>z = 0.6</i> in the <a
href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/frontier/">Hubble Frontier
Fields</a> cluster AS1063, undergoing a starburst, with a giant
kiloparsec-sized clump (left panel). When we compare the clump's size and
SFR to UV/optically selected samples (right panel) we find that it as
luminous and large as the clumps at high redshift (<a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877....7W/abstract">Walth
et al. 2019</a>). While this giant 1 kpc luminous H II region (10
M<sub>&#9737;</sub>/yr) resembles clumps at high redshift, it only has gas
fraction of 0.26, hinting that the star formation process could be
different for dusty, star-forming galaxies. Recent work by <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...869...11C/abstract">Cosens
et al. (2018)</a> has shown evidence that there are two populations of clump
formation, which depends on whether the galaxy is undergoing a starburst.
