<h3>TMT/IRIS ETC</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tmt.org/etc/iris">IRIS Exposure Time Calculator
(IRIS ETC)</a> is a tool designed to help develop science cases for IRIS on
the <a href="https://www.tmt.org">Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)</a>. <a
href="https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/IRIS.html">IRIS</a> is a near-IR (0.8 - 2.4
microns) integral field spectrograph, which will work at the diffraction
limit of TMT. IRIS is an imager and a spectrograph with a sequential
design, such that a pickoff mirror will be used to feed imager optics to
the spectrograph. This sequential design will allow IRIS to operate both of
the imager and spectrograph simultaneously.</p> 

<p>
The IRIS ETC is currently being adapted to work with <a
href="https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/osiris/">OSIRIS</a> and the newly
designed instrument <a href="https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/LIGER.html">LIGER</a>
for the Keck I AO upgrade <a href="https://keckao.github.io/kapa">KAPA
(Keck All-sky Precision Adaptive-optics)</a>. The source code for the IRIS
ETC can be found here - <a

<h3> Carnegie Python Distribution</h3>

<p>The <a
href="http://code.obs.carnegiescience.edu/carnegie-python-distribution">Carnegie
Python distribution (CarPy)</a> is collection of Python routines for data
reduction and analysis for instruments on Magellan (i.e. IMACS, FourStar,
LDSS3, MagE and MIKE). CarPy includes many standard open source Python
packages such as NumPy and SciPy. I helped contribute to the development of
CarPy, which includes writing routines and designing the distribution. 

<h3>COSMOS</h3>

<p><a href="http://code.obs.carnegiescience.edu/cosmos">The Carnegie
Observatories System for MultiObject Spectroscopy (COSMOS)</a> is one of
the Carnegie data pipelines for reducing multiobject and longslit spectra
from Magellan IMACS and LDSS3. I helped contribute to its development. In
particular I wrote the C code for the ldss3-pattern noise removal routine
which is designed to remove the high frequency pattern noise in Fourier
space that can intermittently appear on the LDSS3 detectors. I'm currently
working on investigating whether this can be updated to include the LDSS3-C
detectors.

<!-- p>I created a package that builds the prerequisites needed by COSMOS. It has been tested with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
and Ubuntu 11.04.  It is a simple Makefile which needs to be modified for
the installation path.  The gcc and g77 dependencies are included with the
Snow Leopard version.  Obvious improvements are to make a configure script
and also change g77 to gfortran.</br>
